## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project so you can run it on your mobile or develop.
You can also find on this a brief about how this app works, licenses, screenshot and how to contribute.

## Pre-requesites
It should be working on an android phone running [Ice Cream Sandwich API 16](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0-highlights) version 4.1 or later.
If you worryied about RAM and ROM, stop! It only needs about 20 MB of storage for basic installation. But the size increases as you save more data. And RAM dont even come to talk.
### For developers only
It was built using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/features/) 3.2.1 with the latest gradle and patterns and latest Firebase SDKs.

## Version
This is an alpha version and all the data is on the cloud. You may find some bugs i believe so (not that i did found it). Please report.
From the settings panel you can go to the support channel (actually it is a whatsapp group), or check for new releases.

### For developers only
I use git for versioning. Please read Contributing section.
