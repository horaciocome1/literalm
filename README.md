# Literal M
Android app that serves as front-end to the mozambican literature (poems, lyrics, books and more).

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project so you can run it on your mobile or develop.
You can also find on this a brief about how this app works, licenses, screenshot and how to contribute.

## Pre-requesites
It should be working on an android phone running [Ice Cream Sand](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0-highlights) version 4.0 or late.
If you worryied about RAM and ROM, stop! It only needs 3 MB of storage for basic installation. But the size increases as you save more data. And RAM dont even come to talk.
### For developers only
It was built using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/features/) 3.2.1 with the latest gradle and patterns.

## Version
This is an alpha version and the app stores data localy. Im planing on taking advantage of *~*~*~*~  MBaaS to make it relies on the cloud so artits or enthisiasts share their work. No date specified!!
### For developers only
I use git for versioning. Please read Contributing section.
